config WIFI_ACCESS_POINT_SSID
    string "Wi-Fi network name (SSID)"
    default "somenet"
    help
      Wi-Fi network name as an ASCII string.

config WIFI_ACCESS_POINT_PSK
    string "WPA preshared key"
    help
      The key used in WPA-PSK mode can be entered either as
      64 hex-digits, i.e., 32 bytes or as an ASCII passphrase
      (in which case, the real PSK will be generated using
      the passphrase and SSID). ASCII passphrase must be between
      8 and 63 characters (inclusive).

      WARNING! WARNING!
      The key appears as-is in the .config file, and may appear
      in the build log! Avoid using a valuable key if either
      the .config file or the build log may be distributed.
